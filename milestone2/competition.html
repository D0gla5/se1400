        <h4>What they are doing well</h4>
        <p>Interactive sliders of images with statistics about their company. It made navigating simple and made the
            website seem more legit with the statitics</p>
        <h4>What they are doing wrong</h4>
        <p>Some websites had pop up prompts everytime you would click on a new page and it got very annoying. They also
            didn't have alot of color which made the website a little boring to look at. Also some didn't have alot of
            reviews.</p>
        <h4>Why we are better</h4>
        <p>We provide an easy-to-navigate webiste to help viewers easily see what we provide and pursuade them, through
            our images and reviews, to getting involed with purchasing our products. The website won't be bland but will
            have images and a nice color scheme to make things seem up-to-date</p>
